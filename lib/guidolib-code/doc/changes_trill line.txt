			Changes implemented to draw the trill line


Method void ARMusicalVoice::doAutoTrill():
	Called in void GRVoiceManager::BeginManageVoice() 
	Manages the notes and trills to pass the information of trill to the tied notes 
	(and make possible the drawing of the trill line over several tied notes and not only the first one)

Method  float	GRStaff::getXEndPosition(TYPE_TIMEPOSITION pos, TYPE_DURATION dur) :
	Called in void GRSingleNote::OnDraw( VGDevice & hdc) const 
	Returns the spatial end position (x) corresponding to the end of the caller's time duration.
	If it is followed by a note or a rest, the position returned will be just before the rest or note.
	If it is the last note on a staff, the position returned will be exactly on the next bar line.
	Wheter or not the note is tied doesn't matter : the note to which it is tied will not be taken in 
	count in the duration.

Method  void GRTrill::OnDraw(VGDevice & hdc, float right, int nVoice) :
	Called in void GRSingleNote::OnDraw( VGDevice & hdc) const 
	Draws the trill line depending on the position and the voice number given by GRSingleNote, 
	and on his status begin (boolean, default = true) set by ARMusicalVoice::doAutoTrill().

Method virtual float & GRTrill::getLastPosX(int i) :
	Keeps in memory, through a map, the end position of the last trill line drawn for each voice.
