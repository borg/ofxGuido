----------------------------

.. index::
  single: timemap

Gives the mapping between the score and the performance time (i.e. rolled to unrolled time) according to repeat bars and jumps (to coda, da capo, etc.).


**Path**

**Response body**
	* in case of success: 
		| a set of pairs indicating the relation between the score and the performance time, formatted as JSON with ``timemap`` as key.
	  	
	  	Example::

	  		{ "ScoreID" : { 
	  			"timemap" : [
	  					{"score": {"start": "0/1", "end": "1/1"}, 
	  					 "perf":  {"start": "0/1", "end": "1/1"} },
	  					{"score": {"start": "1/1", "end": "2/1"}, 
	  					  "perf": {"start": "1/1", "end": "2/1"} },
	  					{"score": {"start": "2/1", "end": "3/1"}, 
	  					 "perf":  {"start": "0/1", "end": "1/1"} },
	  					{"score": {"start": "3/1", "end": "4/1"}, 
		  				  "perf": {"start": "1/1", "end": "2/1"} }
		  			]
	  			}
	  		}

	* in case of error:
		| An error message formatted as JSON with 'Error' as key.
	  	| Example: ``{ "ScoreID" : {"Error" : "incorrect score ID."} }``
