This document contains the specification of
Advanced GUIDO Music Notation. It builds on 
the "The GUIDO Music Notation Format; 
Specification Part 1: Basic GUIDO", which contains
an introduction to GUIDO Music Notation, 
its basic syntax, and a set of tags covering
the most common musical concepts.

<P>
Advanced GUIDO Notation covers some of the more advanced
concepts not covered in Basic GUIDO Notation such as
glissando, arpeggio, clusters, microtonal alterations,
different types of noteheads, different types of staves,
more barline types and dynamic markings,
advanced concepts for handling lyrics and text,
and some features from contemporary notation.
It also addresses issues of exact score formatting and
layout, such as precise spacing and positioning of 
notation and graphical elements.
Advanced GUIDO Notation is mainly realised by slightly 
extending the Basic GUIDO syntax, introducing new tags, 
and extending the usage of Basic GUIDO tags.


<P>
The GUIDO Notation Format has been developed
by Holger H. Hoos, Darmstadt University of Technology
in Darmstadt, Germany and Keith Hamel, University of British Columbia
in Vancouver, Canada; the Advanced GUIDO Specification 
is additionally co-authored by Kai Renz and 
J&uuml;rgen Kilian, Darmstadt University of Technology.
The Advanced GUIDO Notation Format is publicly and freely 
available; it can and should be freely used for arbitrary 
scientific, educational or commercial purposes. However, 
the Avanced GUIDO Notation Format specification remains 
the intellectual property of the authors of this document. 
It is our wish that every publicly available software 
supporting GUIDO and every extension of GUIDO as specified 
in this document should be brought to our attention.
