GUIDO server regtest.

To run the regtests for the first time, type:

python test.py baseline

and

python test.py check

In theory, nothing should differ.

For subsequent runs, make sure to stash the old folder before you create a
new one.  i.e.:

rm -rf check/
python test.py check

Otherwise, the script will complain.

If there is a difference betwen the baseline and check, the script will show
the URL as well as change in the result.  For example:

<snip>
URL sent to the server:
32cd115bcaff3272c4ab8c28d5698b8ace5012c5/staffmap?staff=1

This means that the URL sent to the server was
32cd115bcaff3272c4ab8c28d5698b8ace5012c5/staffmap?staff=1.  In the old
version, the return code was 500, but in the new one, the return code was
200.

This info can be written to a logfile (run the script with -h for more
info).

Internally, the regtest directories are structured as a heirarchy similar
to that of the gmn examples. In terminal directories, there are four files:

*.code = the status code
*.url = the url
*.X = the resulting file, where X is either json, svg, png, gif or jpg
*.type = the MIME type
