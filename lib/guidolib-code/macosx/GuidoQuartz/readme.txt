	Introduction
======================================================================

 The Guido Quartz Viewer is a simple application to view and print 
Guido Music Notation (.gmn) files, using Quartz anti-aliased high 
quality graphics.

  GUIDO Music Notation is a textbased, humanreadable format 
to represent music. It is intended to describe musical 
information as well as notational information. In GUIDO, 
simple music can be described in a simple way, whereas 
complex music sometimes requires more complex representations.
