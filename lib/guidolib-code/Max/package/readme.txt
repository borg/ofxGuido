The 'guido' external displays music scores.
It is based on the Guido Music Notation language and accepts litteral Guido 
code or Guido files as input. The score layout is achieved using the 
Guido Engine library.

In addition and when the libmusicxml2 library is available, it also supports 
the MusicXML format as file input.

The 'guido' external requires the Guido shared library and the guido2.ttf font 
to be installed.
Installation of the libmusicxml2 shared library is optional.

The 'guido' external is part of the Guido Engine open source project.
You can get the source code from the project repository 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/guidolib/).
